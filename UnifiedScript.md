THIS WILL BE THE SCRIPT FOR ALL COUNTRIES.  
THE BASIC IDEA IS WE WILL NEED SOME COUNTRY SPECIFIC SOURCES, BUT WE WILL BRING THIS COUNTRY SPECIFIC DATASOURCE INTO COMMON STAGING TABLES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN THE PROCESS
STARTING WITH MEXICO

However we actually will start with U.S. Soil and Moisture data.

Soil datasource 1: https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/download?basis_of_record=HUMAN_OBSERVATION&basis_of_record=PRESERVED_SPECIMEN&has_coordinate=true&has_geospatial_issue=false&taxon_key=7707728&year=1954,2025&advanced=1&coordinate_uncertainty_in_meters=0,9040&occurrence_status=present
We are going to infer the soil and climate from the geolocation coordinates.

Soil datasource 2: TRY traits: 602, 600, 593, 761, 3410, 1138, 1140, 825, 1144, 30, 603, 1041, 229, 61
